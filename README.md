# medical-records
This is the bachelor degree project summarising 4 years of learning computer science at Politehnica Bucharest.

It is a blockchain application for keeping track of medical records from anywhere around the world without the bureaucratic 
overhead of each country.

At the moment this is not GDPR compliant as, although the data is encrypted and untraceable, it cannot be deleted from the chain.

This was a two-man team project. I developed the frontend + backend and my colleague developed the database which can be found here :
-https://github.com/rotanase/licenta

The application has 3 main components:
  - frontend written in Javascripts  + HTML + CSS using the Electron framework
  - backend written in Golang
  - the blockchain database which is also written in Golang
 
For testing:
  - start the database
  - start the backend
  - start the frontend
